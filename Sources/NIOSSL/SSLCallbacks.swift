/// A custom verification callback.

/// This verification callback is usually called more than once per connection, as it is called once
/// per certificate in the peer's complete certificate chain (including the root CA). The calls proceed
/// from root to leaf, ending with the peer's leaf certificate. Each time it is invoked with 2 arguments:
///
/// 1. The result of the BoringSSL verification for this certificate
/// 2. The ``NIOSSLCertificate`` for this level of the chain.
///
/// Please be cautious with calling out from this method. This method is always invoked on the event loop,
/// so you must not block or wait. It is not possible to return an `EventLoopFuture` from this method, as it
/// must not block or wait. Additionally, this method must take care to ensure that it does not cause any
/// ChannelHandler to recursively call back into the ``NIOSSLHandler`` that triggered it, as making re-entrant
/// calls into BoringSSL is not supported by SwiftNIO and leads to undefined behaviour.
///
/// In general, the only safe thing to do here is to either perform some cryptographic operations, to log,
/// or to store the ``NIOSSLCertificate`` somewhere for later consumption. The easiest way to be sure that the
/// ``NIOSSLCertificate`` is safe to consume is to wait for a user event that shows the handshake as completed,
/// or for channelInactive.
///
/// > Warning: This callback uses the old-style OpenSSL callback behaviour and is excessively complex to program with.

///    and also supports asynchronous certificate verification.

/// 2. An `EventLoopPromise` that must be completed to signal the result of the verification.
